But\nJohn 3:16: for God so loved the world that He gave His one and only begotten Son, so that everyone that believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life. Yeah you heard that right! God wants to give you everlasting life with Him, but that’s not possible when you’re still living in sin and because of that you’ll spend eternity in hell. That’s why Jesus came! So now all you have to do is repent wholeheartedly of your sins and trust in Jesus! He will give you a new heart with new desires and you will be made new and holy. But we’ll never be perfect on this earth, because we’re still in our earthly body. But we’ll be deattached to our flesh and we’ll have our focus on Jesus and God’s kingdom that’s coming! It’s coming very soon btw so please repent (confess and forsake) of your sins and trust in Jesus that He may change you and make you new and give you everlasting life in Heaven without disease, lain, suffering etc. Instead of hell and hellfire.\nSo repent and trust in Jesus!!

I know many authors from other nations, and they are rap, rock, electro, alternative, kantri, whatever, and they are even not comparable.\nWhy? First, it needs MUCH more talent to write some author's song then pop (not talking about other genres here, for example rap can be highly full of meaning when it's not about bad things). You have a strong meaning there because there's good and rich text. Usually (not always) authors also are good in designing melody and voices, so it's good as from musical side and from text side too. \nWhere the meaning hides? Author's song is like a view from a perspective of some person living in any historical (or fictional) epoche. It can be actual (like bards singing about their lives) or imaginable (like you are some abstract warrior from the past or elf or Witcher whatever). Usually bards of course use the guitar because its good for accompanying.\n\nI wish I knew more performers of this genre from other countries. It's interesting to listen, but they are so hard to find. Other genres are quite... poor for me - for example, classical music is great, but it's not some thing you can sing with words. Pop songs are usually too simple and mostly about nothing really deep (not every song, surely)."", ""You can almost sense the raging fire behind them all, and them trying to cover it up, with their almost...

Antonio Stradivari violins seem to be the most endearing ones.  Yet, there are very few left in the world.  I can spot a Stradivari violin just because he had a distinct way of making them.  He did quite a bit of experimenting with appearances, woods and metal for string.  There are still some great violin makers in Germany, Italy, and even the United States of America.Guameri's and Amati's violins can be just as expensive, but theirs is all in quality not quantity.\n\nPernambuco bows are the most sought after bows due to shortage of the wood and its quality.  I have yet to see one cost less than $600.\n\nMy middle school Orchestra teacher was a professional violinist whose family owned a music store.  They rented out instruments, which is why most of us rented from them.  They also provided outside lessons from the school.  Now I know not everyone was as lucky as we were at our school.

Up to that point I was in violin and wanted to transition into playing in the orchestra fully but also learn a different instrument. I was immediately accepted without having to audition as if I was new to playing any instrument because I was already part of the small violin group that sometimes performed with the orchestra/band (the violin group didn't rehearse with the orchestra/band normally, only for perfomances) and also because my older sister was part of it. \n\nI was rehearsing and trying out the saxophone with the other who got accepted with me when this fucking pile of 6th grades came into the class. There they went through different things like seeing which intrument they wanted, if they could possibly play it or make a sound out of the mouthpiece. Since there were alot of students, atleast 1 or 2/4 of them got accepted. When the day to actually come to practice in the afternoons came most didnt show up, I really dont know why, but the rest came and they were all in a room with their mouthpieces and starter pieces while I was outside practicing with my sax tenor and violin. I kid you not, during I was practicing atleast 20 12 year somethings walked out of the classroom every like 10 minutes, some came out crying and shit. At the end only like 10 - 7 actually got to play the full instrument for an opcoming performance and were accepted to be part of it. But holy shit, I experienced once one of the conductor's scolds and nearly cried because I felt so embarassed and it was just the sax subunit there. From that day on I practice 6 hours in the afternoon and make sure to always ace every piece because ffs that scold was really something.

I had social anxiety, never went to uni., burned out in high school,  kept playing alone, and only 20 yes later have I looked up techniques on how to overcome my shaky bow. I wish this video existed back then. I'm in tears for what I've overcome alone.  Thank you for making this video♡"", 'I think this can also be applied  to creative careers in general.', 'A very nice video, thank you both :-)', 'Thank you for talking about this. As an autistic music producer (original works), struggling with panic and depression disorders and neuromuscular problems, I identify with the descriptions of what chronic depression is like; imagine what Brett said but for months or years to the point it is all you can identify with, the point of living is constantly up for internal debate, a sense of hopelessness it will never change, that there\'s nothing to look forward to except daily struggle. Basic executive function becomes as precious a commodity as water in a drought. I haven\'t produced a track in a small handful of years, after a series of bad breakdowns. It got so bad I eventually committed the ultimate sin and broke an instrument in sheer despair (an old MIDI keyboard, but it had sentimental value and I felt *horrendous* afterwards, I can\'t even bring myself to throw it away. I might make a wall sculpture out of it).\n\nI\'m doing a little better after some time in the hospital a few months ago, and totally removing alcohol from my life. Every time one of you says ""go practice"" I get ever so much closer to turning on my computer and just noodling with modular sound design, or aleatoric counterpoint, just to get gradually back into the joy of summoning sounds from electrons, until I can afford to get a proper size keyboard and practice piano skills again.\nIt\'s still a struggle, but I\'ve stopped actively judging myself, and am getting better at accepting my limitations so that I can work through them at my own pace. I spend many days slowly getting into a more flexible mindset, so I am thinking more lucidly by nighttime, which gradually improves by the day, mostly; waking up is often the hardest thing to do, so it\'s a bit of a three steps forward two steps back kind of process. The insomnia doesn\'t help; I do have a good psychiatrist though and am gradually tapering my meds (which keep my nervous system from spiralling out of physical control, but also dampen my personality and motivation), but I really need to see a neurologist to figure out how not to need such strong meds to function physically.\n\nSpeaking of meds, I knew the beta blocker thing was coming as soon as performance anxiety was mentioned. I\'m actually prescribed a beta blocker as one of my anxiety meds; I\'ve found they can be useful for training oneself to stop panicking naturally (tho these days I\'m on it to keep peripheral adrenaline activity in check); when using them for anxiety over one event, by paying attention to the feeling of panic starting, and then hitting the pharmaceutical wall, you can memorize the sensation of rising over the panic, and then one can invoke that feeling without drugs. Beta blockers are definitely a temptation in those situations and I can easily see becoming psychologically dependent. They aren\'t addictively dangerous when not taken daily, but in my case I have to taper off because long term use and stopping suddenly can be dangerous for the heart. As another commenter mentioned, beta blockers can also really dull one\'s joy de vivre so to speak. I take meds to hit a stable baseline though, so it\'s a different context. The first time I was prescribed beta blockers it was for occasional social panic attacks, and they helped me get over it just by experiencing what it\'s like not to feel it. Installed some healthy thought patterns then I didn\'t need it again for years when my nerves and muscles got really screwed up to the point that I have proprioception errors (really disorienting and not fun, accompanied by a whole different flavor of panic). Mindfulness is absolutely one of the best tools for navigating mental distress. All of the advice given was absolutely spot on in my knowledge and experience. Thanks again for all you do.', ""I've only just found your channel some weeks ago so I've some catching up to do, but I want to say thank you for sharing your stories. I think that awareness for these psychological problems should be raised as early in life as possible. Children need to be told that it's okay and important to talk about emotions.. it's ok to cry, it's ok to not feel well.. they need to know of the point when it's becoming unhealthy and where to get help. It's so important. \nI went to therapy for a year some time ago and it changed my life. It's nothing to be ashamed of.

It felt more like she was ""fantasizing"" the Piece instead of reciting it. It was way more differentiated, regarding the technical AND expressiv dynamics.\n\nAnd that is a very interesting development of the way how the people interpret this Bach piece. \nYou still got the same notes, but the way people see and feel about them and express them in consequence changed so much.\n\nMaybe it is just an epochial development, influenced by the social changes we went through the last years (Awareness Movements for example).\n\nBut when we came to ""meditation"" i developed another hypothesis.\n\nMaybe the reason they played so powerful back then, is due to the technical limitations regarding recording and Sound devices.\nYou had to play loud so the recording could get all of it.\nAlso they didn\'t have great microphones, Speakers/ PA\'s and stuff which could address the sound fairly to the audience.\nI mean, thats the reason stringend instruments went from gut, nylon etc. To steel, because they are louder. And why people started to relying more on electrical instruments (e-guitare, singing over microphone). Otherwise you couldn\'t address that many listeners.\n\n\nBut nonetheless, i enjoyed all the Bach interpretations you showed. Of course, everyone got his own preferences. But that is why i think that it is great, that we have so many different ways of approaches to single pieces (""Interpretation""). \nSo everyone can listen to, what suits his (or her) preferences/ style/ taste the best. And musicians can play ""themselves"".\n\nThat\'s why i think, that we shouldn\'t consider different approaches in categories like ""it\'s forbidden to play it like this"" / ""you wouldn\'t play it like this today"" etc. \nBecause music is creative and living.\nAnd when you put to much restrictions on it, it dies.\n\nBest regards\nJM\nPS: Got no musicial degree, but am a musician myself. \nAnd i am convinced, that all creative forms of expressions need a certain amount of freedom so they can develop themselves in a healthy way.']"

He studied at the Vienna Conservatory under Anton Bruckner, Jakob Don\'t and Joseph Hellmesberger Jr., and in Paris, where his teachers included Léo Delibes, Lamburt Massart and Jules Massenet. While in Paris, he won the ""Premier Grand Prix de Rome"" gold medal at the age of 12, competing against 40 other players, all of whom were at least 20 years of age.\n\nHe made his United States debut at the Steinway Hall in New York City on November 10, 1888, and his first tour of the United States in 1888 - 1889 with Moris Rosenthal. He then returned to Austria and applied for a position in the Vienna Philharmonic, but was turned down by the concentrated Arnold Rosé. As a result, he left music to study medicine. He spent a brief time in the army before returning to the violin in 1899, when he gave a concert with the Berlin Philharmonic conducted by Arthur Nikish. It was this concert and a series of American tours from 1901 to 1903 that brought him real acclaim. Kreisler was also an exellent pianist, and his piano playing is preserved in Ampico reproducing piano rolls.\n\nIn 1910, Kreisler gave premiere of Sir Edward Elgar\'s Violin Concerto, a work commisioned by and dedicated to him. He served briefly in the Austrian Army in World War I before being honorably discharged after he was wounded. He arrived in New York on November 24, 1914, and spent the remainder of the warin America. He returned to Europe in 1924, living first in Berlin, then moving to France in 1938. Shortly thereafter, at the outbreak of World War II, he settled once again in the United States, becoming a naturalized citizen in 1943. He lived there for the rest of his life, giving his last public concert in 1947, and broadcasting performances for a few years after that.\n\nOn April 26, 1941, he was involved in a serious traffic accident. Struck by a truck while crossing a street in New York, he suffered a fractured a d was in coma for over a week.\n\nIn his later years, he suffered from not only some hearing loss but also sight deterioration due to cataracts.\n\nKreisler died of a heart condition aggravated by old age in New York City in 1962.

Even for those who are born as bilingual or polyglots, they may not have a direct translation in their head, but they understand the inherent meaning of the word themselves.

It's like if T-Series came back at him like that, they would've insulted his nation too and he belongs to two. That's offensive to say that least. And a nation is made up of not just a collective name to refer to, it's millions of people and their issues and situations both individual and collective being made fun of and being laughed at by the rest of the world. The genuine problems the country could be facing were turned into a laughing diss rap. And what for? His channel losing the title of holding maximum number of subscribers (which he has since then lost with T-Series now having nearly twice the amount of subs that him) who all probably belong to so many different countries, including India. It was basically an insult to some of his followers too who he didn't stop to think about because he had so many.\n\nI get the dissing and I'm more accomodating than that to not get past the joke and let things go and just enjoy but his diss wasn't funny or worth joking about. Some things should be taken seriously and not lightly no matter what. Maybe seeing it from a different nation's perspective, it seems okay because of course, it's not about you.

That\'s all. \n\n☆For topic markers, this can be trickier - it\'s mostly used when you are 1. emphasizing or 2. mentioning something that was previously mentioned (aka old info) \n1.In English, you can see this as the term, \'as for.\'   E.g., ""I\'m leaving this at home. As for [this], I\'m taking it with me.""  <--this sentence makes the emphasis more apparent. \nThe same would go for what Josh said at 4:53, ""If someone is saying that \'this is coffee, this is water...\'"" Here, if you were to ask about the other (bottles? containers?), you would be saying, ""then what is [this]?"" , placing an emphasis on [this], hence why you would use the topic marker. \n\n2.

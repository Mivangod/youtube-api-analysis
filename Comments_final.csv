God wants to give you everlasting life with Him, but that’s not possible when you’re still living in sin and because of that you’ll spend eternity in hell. That’s why Jesus came! So now all you have to do is repent wholeheartedly of your sins and trust in Jesus! He will give you a new heart with new desires and you will be made new and holy. But we’ll never be perfect on this earth, because we’re still in our earthly body. But we’ll be deattached to our flesh and we’ll have our focus on Jesus and God’s kingdom that’s coming! It’s coming very soon btw so please repent (confess and forsake) of your sins and trust in Jesus that He may change you and make you new and give you everlasting life in Heaven without disease, lain, suffering etc. Instead of hell and hellfire.\nSo repent and trust in Jesus!!

I know many authors from other nations, and they are rap, rock, electro, alternative, kantri, whatever, and they are even not comparable.\nWhy? First, it needs MUCH more talent to write some author's song then pop (not talking about other genres here, for example rap can be highly full of meaning when it's not about bad things). You have a strong meaning there because there's good and rich text. Usually (not always) authors also are good in designing melody and voices, so it's good as from musical side and from text side too. \nWhere the meaning hides? Author's song is like a view from a perspective of some person living in any historical (or fictional) epoche. It can be actual (like bards singing about their lives) or imaginable (like you are some abstract warrior from the past or elf or Witcher whatever). Usually bards of course use the guitar because its good for accompanying.\n\nI wish I knew more performers of this genre from other countries. It's interesting to listen, but they are so hard to find. Other genres are quite... poor for me - for example, classical music is great, but it's not some thing you can sing with words.

Antonio Stradivari violins seem to be the most endearing ones.  Yet, there are very few left in the world.  I can spot a Stradivari violin just because he had a distinct way of making them.  He did quite a bit of experimenting with appearances, woods and metal for string.  There are still some great violin makers in Germany, Italy, and even the United States of America.Guameri's and Amati's violins can be just as expensive, but theirs is all in quality not quantity.\n\nPernambuco bows are the most sought after bows due to shortage of the wood and its quality.  I have yet to see one cost less than $600.\n\nMy middle school Orchestra teacher was a professional violinist whose family owned a music store.  They rented out instruments, which is why most of us rented from them.  They also provided outside lessons from the school.  Now I know not everyone was as lucky as we were at our school.

Up to that point I was in violin and wanted to transition into playing in the orchestra fully but also learn a different instrument. I was immediately accepted without having to audition as if I was new to playing any instrument because I was already part of the small violin group that sometimes performed with the orchestra/band (the violin group didn't rehearse with the orchestra/band normally, only for perfomances) and also because my older sister was part of it. \n\nI was rehearsing and trying out the saxophone with the other who got accepted with me when this fucking pile of 6th grades came into the class. There they went through different things like seeing which intrument they wanted, if they could possibly play it or make a sound out of the mouthpiece. Since there were alot of students, atleast 1 or 2/4 of them got accepted. When the day to actually come to practice in the afternoons came most didnt show up, I really dont know why, but the rest came and they were all in a room with their mouthpieces and starter pieces while I was outside practicing with my sax tenor and violin. I kid you not, during I was practicing atleast 20 12 year somethings walked out of the classroom every like 10 minutes, some came out crying and shit. At the end only like 10 - 7 actually got to play the full instrument for an opcoming performance and were accepted to be part of it. But holy shit, I experienced once one of the conductor's scolds and nearly cried because I felt so embarassed and it was just the sax subunit there. From that day on I practice 6 hours in the afternoon and make sure to always ace every piece because ffs that scold was really something.

I wish this video existed back then. I'm in tears for what I've overcome alone.  Thank you for making this video♡"", 'I think this can also be applied  to creative careers in general.', 'A very nice video, thank you both :-)', 'Thank you for talking about this. As an autistic music producer (original works), struggling with panic and depression disorders and neuromuscular problems, I identify with the descriptions of what chronic depression is like; imagine what Brett said but for months or years to the point it is all you can identify with, the point of living is constantly up for internal debate, a sense of hopelessness it will never change, that there\'s nothing to look forward to except daily struggle. Basic executive function becomes as precious a commodity as water in a drought. I haven\'t produced a track in a small handful of years, after a series of bad breakdowns. It got so bad I eventually committed the ultimate sin and broke an instrument in sheer despair (an old MIDI keyboard, but it had sentimental value and I felt *horrendous* afterwards, I can\'t even bring myself to throw it away. I might make a wall sculpture out of it).\n\nI\'m doing a little better after some time in the hospital a few months ago, and totally removing alcohol from my life. Every time one of you says ""go practice"" I get ever so much closer to turning on my computer and just noodling with modular sound design, or aleatoric counterpoint, just to get gradually back into the joy of summoning sounds from electrons, until I can afford to get a proper size keyboard and practice piano skills again.\nIt\'s still a struggle, but I\'ve stopped actively judging myself, and am getting better at accepting my limitations so that I can work through them at my own pace. I spend many days slowly getting into a more flexible mindset, so I am thinking more lucidly by nighttime, which gradually improves by the day, mostly; waking up is often the hardest thing to do, so it\'s a bit of a three steps forward two steps back kind of process. The insomnia doesn\'t help; I do have a good psychiatrist though and am gradually tapering my meds (which keep my nervous system from spiralling out of physical control, but also dampen my personality and motivation), but I really need to see a neurologist to figure out how not to need such strong meds to function physically.\n\nSpeaking of meds, I knew the beta blocker thing was coming as soon as performance anxiety was mentioned. I\'m actually prescribed a beta blocker as one of my anxiety meds; I\'ve found they can be useful for training oneself to stop panicking naturally (tho these days I\'m on it to keep peripheral adrenaline activity in check); when using them for anxiety over one event, by paying attention to the feeling of panic starting, and then hitting the pharmaceutical wall, you can memorize the sensation of rising over the panic, and then one can invoke that feeling without drugs. Beta blockers are definitely a temptation in those situations and I can easily see becoming psychologically dependent. They aren\'t addictively dangerous when not taken daily, but in my case I have to taper off because long term use and stopping suddenly can be dangerous for the heart. As another commenter mentioned, beta blockers can also really dull one\'s joy de vivre so to speak. I take meds to hit a stable baseline though, so it\'s a different context. The first time I was prescribed beta blockers it was for occasional social panic attacks, and they helped me get over it just by experiencing what it\'s like not to feel it. Installed some healthy thought patterns then I didn\'t need it again for years when my nerves and muscles got really screwed up to the point that I have proprioception errors (really disorienting and not fun, accompanied by a whole different flavor of panic). Mindfulness is absolutely one of the best tools for navigating mental distress. All of the advice given was absolutely spot on in my knowledge and experience. Thanks again for all you do.', ""I've only just found your channel some weeks ago so I've some catching up to do, but I want to say thank you for sharing your stories. I think that awareness for these psychological problems should be raised as early in life as possible. Children need to be told that it's okay and important to talk about emotions.. it's ok to cry, it's ok to not feel well.. they need to know of the point when it's becoming unhealthy and where to get help. It's so important. \nI went to therapy for a year some time ago and it changed my life. It's nothing to be ashamed of.

It felt more like she was ""fantasizing"" the Piece instead of reciting it. It was way more differentiated, regarding the technical AND expressiv dynamics.\n\nAnd that is a very interesting development of the way how the people interpret this Bach piece. \nYou still got the same notes, but the way people see and feel about them and express them in consequence changed so much.\n\nMaybe it is just an epochial development, influenced by the social changes we went through the last years (Awareness Movements for example).\n\nBut when we came to ""meditation"" i developed another hypothesis.\n\nMaybe the reason they played so powerful back then, is due to the technical limitations regarding recording and Sound devices.\nYou had to play loud so the recording could get all of it.\nAlso they didn\'t have great microphones, Speakers/ PA\'s and stuff which could address the sound fairly to the audience.\nI mean, thats the reason stringend instruments went from gut, nylon etc. To steel, because they are louder. And why people started to relying more on electrical instruments (e-guitare, singing over microphone). Otherwise you couldn\'t address that many listeners.\n\n\nBut nonetheless, i enjoyed all the Bach interpretations you showed. Of course, everyone got his own preferences. But that is why i think that it is great, that we have so many different ways of approaches to single pieces (""Interpretation""). \nSo everyone can listen to, what suits his (or her) preferences/ style/ taste the best. And musicians can play ""themselves"".\n\nThat\'s why i think, that we shouldn\'t consider different approaches in categories like ""it\'s forbidden to play it like this"" / ""you wouldn\'t play it like this today"" etc. \nBecause music is creative and living.\nAnd when you put to much restrictions on it, it dies.\n\nBest regards\nJM\nPS: Got no musicial degree, but am a musician myself. \nAnd i am convinced, that all creative forms of expressions need a certain amount of freedom so they can develop themselves in a healthy way.']"

He studied at the Vienna Conservatory under Anton Bruckner, Jakob Don\'t and Joseph Hellmesberger Jr., and in Paris, where his teachers included Léo Delibes, Lamburt Massart and Jules Massenet. While in Paris, he won the ""Premier Grand Prix de Rome"" gold medal at the age of 12, competing against 40 other players, all of whom were at least 20 years of age.\n\nHe made his United States debut at the Steinway Hall in New York City on November 10, 1888, and his first tour of the United States in 1888 - 1889 with Moris Rosenthal. He then returned to Austria and applied for a position in the Vienna Philharmonic, but was turned down by the concentrated Arnold Rosé. As a result, he left music to study medicine. He spent a brief time in the army before returning to the violin in 1899, when he gave a concert with the Berlin Philharmonic conducted by Arthur Nikish. It was this concert and a series of American tours from 1901 to 1903 that brought him real acclaim. Kreisler was also an exellent pianist, and his piano playing is preserved in Ampico reproducing piano rolls.\n\nIn 1910, Kreisler gave premiere of Sir Edward Elgar\'s Violin Concerto, a work commisioned by and dedicated to him. He served briefly in the Austrian Army in World War I before being honorably discharged after he was wounded. He arrived in New York on November 24, 1914, and spent the remainder of the warin America. He returned to Europe in 1924, living first in Berlin, then moving to France in 1938. Shortly thereafter, at the outbreak of World War II, he settled once again in the United States, becoming a naturalized citizen in 1943. He lived there for the rest of his life, giving his last public concert in 1947, and broadcasting performances for a few years after that.\n\nOn April 26, 1941, he was involved in a serious traffic accident. Struck by a truck while crossing a street in New York, he suffered a fractured a d was in coma for over a week.\n\nIn his later years, he suffered from not only some hearing loss but also sight deterioration due to cataracts.\n\nKreisler died of a heart condition aggravated by old age in New York City in 1962.

Then, he plays again with different ornamentation and variations. A true master of trad fiddle. By the way the name fiddle was used for this instrument before violin. Another channel I've discovered which is really useful is early music sources. Also well worth subscribing to. In order to understand what we are playing now, we need to look at the history.

Others suffered long-term health problems, and those lucky enough to have escaped any bad effects to themselves probably felt immense guilt, since the products that they produced were used by Japanese soldiers to kill thousands of Chinese soldiers and civilians.\n\nAfter the war, a huge number of the chemical weapons (at least 400 tons) were buried in China by fleeing Japanese soldiers and since then, an estimated 2000 people have died after having accidentally come into contact with them. :(\n\nSome say\xa0that the rabbits on the island are descendants of rabbits selected to be\xa0used to test the effects of the gas, but were released instead. Others say\xa0that\xa0 Japanese schoolchildren released rabbits there. Either way,\xa0their numbers have obviously grown dramatically since then! :)\xa0\nThere is a small museum dedicated to the above-mentioned wartime activities carried out on the island, created by a former worker of the chemical factory. His name is Hatsuichi Murakami and\xa0his belief is\xa0stated in the following quote:\n“My hope is that people will see the museum in Hiroshima City and also this one, so they will learn that we [Japanese] were both victims and aggressors in the war.

This attitude probably stems from the origin of the U.S. Army as the People's Army from the Revolutionary War.  The peacetime U.S. Army endeavored to set time aside for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  The exception might be some particular, fast-moving field exercise that simulated a battle.

I wanted to make a note on Aracne's story. Aracne was actually an arrogant woman who believed she could even beat the gods herself in her art. This of course enraged Hera, who transformed into an old lady and challenged her to a big duel. Aracne won and arrogantly stated that even Hera herself wouldn't be able to beat her, without knowing the goddess was right there. Hera was infuriated and extremely jealous, which was logical after having a mortal hurt her pride. So she turned Aracne, (her name also is the greek word for spider) into the insect we know today and cursed her to create beautiful webs that people would always destroy."", '아는만큼 보인다의 예시']"

Even for those who are born as bilingual or polyglots, they may not have a direct translation in their head, but they understand the inherent meaning of the word themselves.

It's like if T-Series came back at him like that, they would've insulted his nation too and he belongs to two. That's offensive to say that least. And a nation is made up of not just a collective name to refer to, it's millions of people and their issues and situations both individual and collective being made fun of and being laughed at by the rest of the world. The genuine problems the country could be facing were turned into a laughing diss rap. And what for? His channel losing the title of holding maximum number of subscribers (which he has since then lost with T-Series now having nearly twice the amount of subs that him) who all probably belong to so many different countries, including India. It was basically an insult to some of his followers too who he didn't stop to think about because he had so many.\n\nI get the dissing and I'm more accomodating than that to not get past the joke and let things go and just enjoy but his diss wasn't funny or worth joking about. Some things should be taken seriously and not lightly no matter what. Maybe seeing it from a different nation's perspective, it seems okay because of course, it's not about you.

That\'s all. \n\n☆For topic markers, this can be trickier - it\'s mostly used when you are 1. emphasizing or 2. mentioning something that was previously mentioned (aka old info) \n1.In English, you can see this as the term, \'as for.\'   E.g., ""I\'m leaving this at home. As for [this], I\'m taking it with me.""  <--this sentence makes the emphasis more apparent. \nThe same would go for what Josh said at 4:53, ""If someone is saying that \'this is coffee, this is water...\'"" Here, if you were to ask about the other (bottles? containers?), you would be saying, ""then what is [this]?"" , placing an emphasis on [this], hence why you would use the topic marker. \n\n2.

I'm sure if I can get ahold of real wasabi it'll be better than 'green horseradish' but a little harder for me to come across, and maybe once I get close to finishing I'll taste one and see if paprika would be good for a splash of color or try something different.

Cook it in a rice cooker, a multi-cooker, or on the stove using the absorption method.  \xa0\n\nFurikake – This is a type of Japanese seasoning usually sprinkled over cooked rice. It’s made from a blend of ingredients like dried bonito flakes, sesame seeds, seaweed, egg, salt, sugar and various spices. There are so many furikake flavours out there, so look for packets of assorted furikake flavours and experiment to find your favourite! You can get them from your nearby Asian grocer or online, or even make your own.  \xa0\n\nNori – This is the flat seaweed wrapper also used to wrap sushi. You can find it online, at Asian grocers or even from well stocked supermarkets either in full size squares or in mini pre-cut strips. It’s not essential, but does make for a great little hand hold for your homemade jelly donuts.  \xa0\n\n\n\n 1.Pop your cooked rice into a nice mixing bowl. Add the furikake or rice flavouring and mix through evenly. Separate the rice into equal portions, big enough to be a large handful each.\n\n 2. Wet your hands with water and rub together with a pinch or two of salt. This stops the rice sticking to your hands and helps keep it fresher for longer.\xa0\n\n3. Take up one portion of rice in your hands.\xa0\n\n4. If you are hiding some fillings inside, here is where you make an indent, place the ingredients inside and fold the rice over, then lightly press into a ball.  \xa0\n\n5.Squeezing the jelly donut into a ball shape.  Pressing the edges of the jelly donut into a triangle shape. Holding the finished jelly donut rice ball.  Using mainly your fingertips while resting the rice on your palm, start to press and squeeze the rice into a triangular shape, rotating as you go so it’s even.\xa0\n\n6.

We would get to the point that if either one of us went to sleep we would out for hours because our bodies would just be so tired and drained.  Mexico is a true culture shock.

As in, you don\'t want to go here unless A) you\'re wealthy, and I mean really rich or B) you are somehow working with a corporate expense account and are therefore unaccountable personally for these charges or C), you are enjoying a once-in-a-blue-moon splurge, maybe a trip out from Jersey with the wife and kids, perhaps for the holidays or a favored relative\'s birthday.  \n\nNot that it\'s a bad experience.  Quite the opposite, for to be catered to in this manner on a regular basis would be the very height of luxury.  There is nothing wrong with Japanese Wagyu at ninety bucks per tiny serving save for the niggling detail of paying for it.  It\'s nohing that a winning Powerball ticket couldn\'t solve.\n\nIn the end, it isn\'t even about the steak.  Great steak is now available at retail for a fraction of what these fine filets cost.  What it\'s about at Del Frisco\'s is the real estate; lots of it, elbow and leg room and no one seated too close to your table, elegantly set with white tablecloth.  You feel like a captain at your table, presiding over your own personal ship of hospitality, the final cost of which will sadly accrue to you.  A captain of industry is what you should be if attending this fine spot as anything other than a lucky guest.  \n\nSecondarily, you are paying for ""service"" which is spotless.  Even the wine recommendations were right on target once I identified my favored price range (low); our waiter was attractive and charming and didn\'t even try to pick up my girlfriend, which was appreciated.  \n\nSo who is this place for?

A trip to Del Frisco\'s may be in the cards for you.  Or another scenario: Let us suppose you own your own company which just went public on Wall Street, just down the street.  Once again, celebrating at Del Frisco\'s may be an appropriate, fun way to blow off steam.  \n\nBut what if you\'re not really crazy, stupid rich?

Highly admired, she was apprehended tragically on Mili Atoll (Marshall Islands) by Imperial Japan in July 1937  for photo reconnaissance, endured brutal agony, only to expire on Saipan, never to return home again.  Since this  heartbraking story is humiliating for the federal govt., the powers-that-be have fooled the public,  never exposing the truth. Amelia Earhart investigator Fred Goerner sent a 1990 letter warning TIGHAR’s Ric Gillespie the media would not tolerate false theories claiming Amelia Earhart’s alleged July 1937 landing on Nikumaroro. TIGHAR’s claim of Earharts’s demise on Nikumaroro,  original hypothesis from Fred J. Hooven (1982), is a bamboozle, diverting the public from the historical fact of A. Earhart and F. Noonan’s perishing on Saipan for espionage.  After the disappearance, Navy Task Force planes rigorously searched  the immediate area of Nikumaroro in July 1937 and found the island unoccupied. Hooven soon abandoned the Gardner Island (Nikumaroro) theory after shown that  Gilbertese Island settlers had lived on Nikumaroro for many years (1938-1963), without a  trace of  Earhart, Noonan, or the Electra.   In October 1937 English anthropologist Henry Maude, who regarded TIGHAR’s claims as “bull”, visited Nikumaroro and saw nothing related to Earhart, or the Electra only 100 days after their loss.   In July 2017, Marshallese Ministry of Foreign Affairs acknowledged the Jaluit Atoll dock, depicted in  now famous 1937 classified ONI photo, was built by Japanese in 1936, making the photo valid evidence Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan were on Jaluit Island in the summer of 1937. In 1987 , Republic of the Marshall Islands issued a set of 4 commemorative stamps and envelope covers in honor of the 50th anniversary of Amelia’s landing on Mili Atoll on July 2, 1937. For more substantiation, read Mike Campbell’s “Amelia Earhart: The Truth At Last”,  & Rich Martini’s ‘earhartonsaipan.com’. Follow the US military’s, Saipanese and Marshallese corroborated evidence, not govt.-paid scientist or other mouthpiece disinformation. Amelia’s Earhart’s 1937-1944 last days captive are classified and suppressed by the federal govt., due to FDR politics, wartime secrecy, and American-Japanese post-war diplomacy.', 'Thanks for keeping this alive Mikey.
